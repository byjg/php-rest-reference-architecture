# OpenAPI Integration

This document explains what OpenAPI is, how the reference architecture uses it, and how to keep the spec in sync with your code.

## What Is OpenAPI?

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) (formerly Swagger) is a language-agnostic specification for describing HTTP APIs. A single `openapi.json` file documents every endpoint, its parameters, request bodies, and response schemas. This single source of truth drives:

- **Runtime routing** – `OpenApiRouteList` reads `openapi.json` to map incoming requests to controller methods.
- **Swagger UI** – An interactive browser UI is served at `http://localhost:8080/docs/` so you can explore and test endpoints without a separate tool.
- **Contract testing** – `OpenApiValidation` (via `ByJG\ApiTools`) asserts that every test response conforms to the declared schema.

## How swagger-php Scans `src/`

The project uses [`zircote/swagger-php`](https://zircote.github.io/swagger-php/guide/) to scan PHP attribute annotations in `src/` and produce `public/docs/openapi.json`.

Run the generator whenever you add or change annotations:

```bash
APP_ENV=dev composer run openapi
```

The composer script invokes `swagger-php` with the `src/` directory as the scan target. The output is written to `public/docs/openapi.json`.

## The Generated File

`public/docs/openapi.json` is **generated** and should be committed to version control so that:

- The application can boot without running the generator.
- Tests can validate responses even in CI environments.
- Swagger UI always has an up-to-date spec to render.

## Swagger UI

When the dev server is running, open `http://localhost:8080/docs/` to browse the interactive API documentation. Every endpoint, parameter, and schema defined in `openapi.json` is rendered with a built-in "Try it out" feature.

## Contract Testing Overview

`BaseApiTestCase` mixes in `OpenApiValidation`, which intercepts every `sendRequest()` call and validates the HTTP response against the schema declared in `openapi.json`. This means:

- A missing required field in the response body causes the test to fail.
- An undocumented status code causes the test to fail.
- Schema drift between code and spec is caught automatically in CI.

See [Testing](../guides/testing.md) for practical examples.

## Keeping the Spec in Sync

:::tip Keep docs in sync
Whenever you change PHP attribute annotations in `src/`, rerun `APP_ENV=dev composer run openapi`. The regenerated `public/docs/openapi.json` is what `OpenApiRouteList` reads at runtime and what the tests validate against.
:::

A common workflow:

1. Add or update `#[OA\Get]`, `#[OA\Post]`, etc. attributes in a controller.
2. Run `APP_ENV=dev composer run openapi` to regenerate the spec.
3. Run `APP_ENV=test composer run test` to verify the new endpoint passes contract tests.
4. Commit both the updated controller and the regenerated `openapi.json`.
